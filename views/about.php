		<h2>Bloggity is...</h2>
		<p>...probably the greatest thing since sliced bread. I mean, it's just a blog, but it's simple, sweet, salty, and smooth. It has lots of flashy features that are sure to tickle your fancy. You can mow your law with Bloggity. You can pet your cat with it. You can do just about everything but buy a Mercedes with it. Actually... if your blog rocks hard enough, you might just make enough money to get that ride. Your call. </p>
		<p>There was once a fisherman. He kind of smelled like of fish. Can't blame him. He worked hard all day. One day he get's this crazy idea to start telling people about his everyday experiences pulling monsters from the sea. He says a few words. Gets a couple readers. Says a few more words. Tells some cool stories. All of a sudden...BAM! A few thousand readers are hanging off the edge of their chairs, waiting for his next word. Little funny fisher man is now an internet celeb. Next thing you know, his sex tape will be going viral! Go fish!</p>
